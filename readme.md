# Development Environment Configuration

Customizations for my development environment

Cleaned up my home `.bashrc` by putting all of my customizations into this repository. Now the personal additions section of my home config file looks like below.

```bash
# Personal additions and over-rides
source "$DEVROOT/dev-config/config.sh"
```
